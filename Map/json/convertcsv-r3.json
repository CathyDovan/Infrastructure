The Wawa water treatment system treats water in Wawa and distributes it to 3,000 residents and 110 businesses. Some are located in the Michipicoten River Village which is an additional small urban hamlet in Wawa. Due to the distance the treated water must travel and for fire protection purposes, a water reservoir was installed at this location. Recently, this reservoir was identified as requiring a complete rehabilitation, including a complete relining of the tank and the installation of up to date equipment. The rehabilitation will allow the continued operation of the reservoir to provide a safe source of drinking water to the residents located in the Michipicoten River Village. This rehabilitation may also assist in mitigating the causes of the Trihalomethanes that plague the entire drinking water system. This project is a priority for the Municipality of Wawa. Addition scope change to replace the exterior lining of the Michipicoten River Village water tower. It has been sometime since any rehabilitaion work has been done on this asset. Significant work has been done with the Ministry of the Environment on the issue of Trihalomethnanes which are currently present in the water.  The proposed work is to assist with alleviating this problem. Other rehabilitation work is required on the inside of the reservoir to protect it from freeze \/thaw cycles which result in sediment from the reservoir walls. While the project was being done to complete interior lining, it was noted that the base where the tank is sitting on had started to corrode causing water to get between the tank and the concrete slab, this additional work is required to be completed while exterior lining is being complete and has raised the overall cost of the project to estimate from first request of $225,000.00 to $265,000.00.

A secondary component is a study to evaluate the potential to use waste heat from the incineration process to replace several natural gas Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) units; the study will also evaluate the plant's end of life hydronic heating piping system and any upgrades needed to handle additional heating loads. Biosolids Optimization Study: Currently 40% of the biosolids generated in the City of London are dewatered to 3-4 % solids at satellite plants then trucked to Greenway for incineration.  This study will evaluate the feasibility of dewatering those solids to 25% solids at the satellite plants before transportation to Greenway thereby reducing the number of loads from approximately 7000 per year to 2000. Waste Heat Utilization and Optimization: The Greenway plant currently uses waste heat from the biosolids incinerator to heat most plant buildings and spaces through a hydronic heating system; however, there are several natural gas fired HVAC units onsite that can potentially be converted to utilize the hydronic system.   A study will evaluate the feasibility of converting the natural gas units to the hydronic systems as well as any upgrades needed.

The lagoon would still need to be expanded to address the capacity and infiltration issue. In order to increase capacity and address the infiltration issue, the engineer recommend constructing an additional cell, adjacent to the existing lagoon instead of replacing the water lines. The proposed scope change will address the lagoon capacity issues. The revised scope would be to address large amounts of groundwater and precipitation entering the lagoon through the municipal system. A new cell will be constructed adjacent to the existing lagoon in order to address capacity. The project will also include necessary manhole repairs.         <br \/>Construction Start Date:2017-08-01 <br \/>Construction End Date:2017-10-31            " }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -98.347331, 51.181655, 0.0 ] } }

The City of Guelph's existing Snow Disposal Facility (SDF) requires upgrades to meet provincial best-practices and ensure Guelph's groundwater is protected. Improvements to the facility include an asphalt or clay base, drainage and settling ponds, fencing, and a separate entrance that can be locked during off-hours. An upgrade to the Snow Disposal Facility supports the Federal Government's goal of fostering economic growth and a cleaner and healthier environment, the Province's Source Water Protection legislation, and the City's Groundwater Protection program by reducing the introduction of contaminants and silt from melting snow into water sources such as the Speed River and aquifers. The upgrade will bring the City into compliance with the Province's best practices for the operation of a snow disposal facility and the improvements will enable more efficient operation while ensuring greater safety. The Snow Disposal Facility is used by City departments and third-party contractors for excess snow disposal and in the Spring for stockpiling street-sweepings until removal and disposal under approved contract. Given the proximity of the SDF to source water vulnerability in Guelph, staff determined that improvements to the site were necessary. The Ministry of Environment and Climate Change confirmed in 2015 that the City needs to upgrade its Snow Disposal Facility as soon as possible to meet the Province's best practices. Pre-studies and pre-design work has been approved by council with work ready to begin in Q4 of 2016 with construction from September to November 2017.

This Wastewater Treatment Plant is a Class 3 plant with a rated Average Daily Flow capacity of 19,600 m³\/day, Peak Flow Rate (Dry Weather) of 45,360 m³\/day.  This treatment plant was built in 1981. The plant's mechanical aeration system was replaced in 2010 with a fine bubbler system.  However the Port Colborne area often has  power outages that cause issues with the plant's electrical equipment. Because of this problem the aeration blowers were damaged during a power outage. A temporary multistage centrifuge blower was installed  to keep the plant in operation until a more permanent solution could be identified.  An engineering study was done to analyze the spare aeration blower capabilities and recommend a solution to ensure Ministry of Environment compliance.  The study concluded that the spare aeration blower is not adequate to meet the rated capacity of the plant, and need to be replaced with properly sized aeration blowers.  Also the installation of appropriate surge suppression technology will be built at this plant to prevent re-occurrence.   The following are the main components of the project:  Installation of new blowers (3 or 4 units depending on equipment suppliers specifications) to provide air to the fine bubbler system.  Installation of surge suppression equipment to provide electrical protection for the blower assemblies.

Challenges: The existing 100m diameter pipes from on Scott Avenue from the intersections of Highway 26 & Saunders Street was built in the 1940s. This sections uses 100mm asbestos pipe that has broken 6 times in the last 10 years, contaminating the river with chlorinated water and does not meet fire flow. The 6 pipe failures resulted in an avg. of 7.5hrs of water system downtime and $1000\/hr in damages.    Project: This project will replace 100 meters (Scott Avenue from HWY 26 to Saunders Street) of existing 100mm diameter piping with heavier, more durable and environmentally friendly 150mm piping that will meet fire flow and help with consistent residential supply and looping. The new pipe will be made from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) replacing the hazardous asbestos pipes. This replacement will reduce\/eliminate incidence of water main breakages and leaks caused by current deficient piping failing. Project Impact on Rehabilitating and modernizing Ontarios aging infrastructure: During pipe failures, there is a significant risk of contamination of chlorinated water to the river and loss to flow.  The replacement of the pipes to 150mm PVC pipes will provide better flow to fire protection and allow for further extension of reliable supply and looping for future infrastructure for main supply to residents and businesses. Projects Impact on Accelerating Short-Term Community Infrastructure Investments: This project will allow us to better ensure the provision of safe drinking water and adequate water pressures to the growing Stayner community in the future. This project will enhance water capacity, as the increased diameter of the replacement pipe will increase volume capacity.

In order to eliminate the overflow onto streets and property causing damage and impacting approximately 924 residents in the area, we need to extend a storm line to the location which is causing the issue.  Currently Crawford Avenue and the combined sewer that is serving the area between College Ave and Erie St W is being flooded by storm water from the adjacent rail road (RR) lands.  Our preliminary investigation last year indicated that all surface water for this vast RR area was connected directly into our combined sewer. As a result, continuous out letting into the combined sewer has led to flooding in our combined sewer system over the course of several days.  During any given heavy rain storm, the pressure of the inflow is so great that it is overflowing out of the manholes causing road flooding over the curbs and into the adjacent warehouses and private property.  The proposed separation project would permit us to study how much storm water is entering the system based on the drainage area, engineer the proper drainage\/retention in the RR lands and separate the existing combined sewer on Crawford Ave. allowing storm water to enter our storm system via Erie St. and into the College Trunk Storm Sewer.

In 2017 the program will carry out upgrades to the Port Weller WWTP grit system. The Port Weller WWTP located in St. Catharines provides wastewater (sanitary) treatment for approximately 75,000 people plus industrial, commercial and institutional needs.  This plant is a Class 4 facility and has a rated capacity of 56,180 m³\/day with a peak primary treatment flow rate of 136,200 m³\/day and a peak secondary treatment flow rate of 112,360 m³\/day. The existing air lift system at the plant has reached the end of its service life and will be replaced with a new pumping system. This will include associated piping, wiring and minor SCADA modifications. Retrofitting the existing air lift pumping system to grit pump and cyclonic grit concentrator will reduce hydraulic loading to the classifier and increase grit removal efficiency. The improvements will increase the grit removal from the plant treatment train and reduce grit accumulation in the sludge digesters.  Additionally it is expected that there will be reduced maintenance related costs. This is from the reduction in replacement of pump impellers and prolonging the cleanout interval of digesters and aeration tanks. In summary these improvements will increase grit capture by 100% and as a result decrease maintenance costs as well as supporting the treatment plants MOECC obligations (rated capacities).

Permanent Pool Volume provided in SWM Facility is 765m3 In 2005, The Region of Peel constructed a storm water Management Facility at Bovaird Drive West and Gillingham Drive a tributary area of 3.74 ha of arterial road drainage. This facility provides storm water Quality Control and Erosion Control and maintain Water Quantity flows below existing flow rates up to the Regional Storm. In 2005 the Ministry of Environment authorized the Region to construct, operate and maintain the prescribed infrastructure, provided that it properly operate and maintain the infrastructure to protect the environment. To demonstrate compliance with the MOECC authorization the Region of Peel operates a monitoring program. The program showed that the facility have deteriorated and that without rehabilitation, will not provide the function as per its original design. The purpose of this project is to restore the original facility functions to protect the environment, enhance the ability of the region through improved technology to operate and maintain the infrastructure, improve the infrastructure efficiency and reduce long term maintenance costs. Following the introduction of MOECC Draft Guidance for Low Impact Development (LID) this project introduce thermal mitigation for the protection of an endangered specie (redside dace). The facilities' design facilitates infiltration of storm water in to the groundwater system at source in order to mimic the natural hydrology of the area, a concept promoted by MOECC .

Increasing flow capacity with new infrastructure will improve municipal water supply in the North end of Guelph, including providing a direct line from the well to the watermain that supplies the Guelph General Hospital.  This will allow  for a total of three separate supply lines to the hospital and thus reduce water supply risks. The existing well is currently underutilized due to limited capacity in the local watermain system.   A large 400 millimetre watermain is proposed from the well on Metcalfe Street to Speedvale Avenue which will connect the well to the 400 millimetre watermain distribution on Speedvale, thus  allowing Water Services to maximize flow from the well to the local area. The sanitary sewers on the street are at the end of their service life and would benefit from the asset management proposed in this submission. The storm sewers also require increased capacity to alleviate localized flooding, as identified in the City's Stormwater Management Master Plan. The project will contribute to economic growth while supporting a cleaner and healthier environment in Guelph. Economic outcomes are enhanced by ensuring the project is undertaken quickly, and reduces the risk of a system failure in the future which would require costly repairs and emergency service. Phase 1 Final Design work would start October 2016 with construction April  September 2017. Phase 1 costs are estimated at $3.6 million while the entire project is projected to cost $7.6 million once completed.

The EA identified the following operational issues with the pumping station. 1.  The new wet well will be designed and built to accommodate periodic inspections, maintenance and cleaning without having to by-passing untreated sewage to the St. Lawrence River as what happens now. 2.  The new mechanical bar screen will be fully automated where screened material will be collected in the appropriate bins rather than accumulating on the floor of the facility and manually placed in garbage bins for disposal, thereby improving the health and safety of the operations staff. 3.  The new wet well will be designed and built such that its size and configuration along with the positioning of the pumps will no longer cause cavitation of Pumps 1 and 2, thereby ensuring the City is maximizing the life span of the pumps. 4.

The hydrant has been removed from regular service until the pipe is replaced. The road surface is in poor condition, and is on a bus route, this makes the project a candidate for reconstruction.   In consultation with our Engineering department we could save during tender for BEL-002 because we received very competitive bids. An item covering excess surplus removal has become a very volatile item in our contracts, so estimates are always conservative. It was not needed here. In addition, the utility relocation costs were also completed for less than initially budgeted. Extension Rationale: Previously approved extension to June 30, 2018 - additional months will ensure Cameron Street addition would be fully completed.

The assessment and pre-design work will confirm final electrical requirements, utility coordination with Brantford Power and costing. Both transformers are 1000kVA\/27.6\/4.16kV delta, primary metered units which provide all of the electrical service required to run the plant. These units are of undetermined age although field observations suggest that they are well over 20 years old. Routine maintenance and inspections indicate that both transformers have far exceeded their service lives and should be replaced to reduce the risk of complete failure, potential disruption to the operation of the plant and potential regulatory compliance issues.

The 2003 Stormwater Management Planning and Design Manual indicates that sediment accumulation reduces the permanent pool volume and the removal efficiency of suspended solids (SS). The SWMP indicates that when the designed removal efficiency of the suspended solids is reduced by 5% or greater, a clean out of the SWM facility is needed by removing the deposited sediment from the permanent pool. This will ensure that the stormwater (SWM) facility remains functional meeting the original design objectives. A 5% reduction in removal efficiency is equivalent to 30% (+\/-) reduction in permanent pool volume. Through the 2015 assessment project, this particular wet pond was determined to be in need of a cleanout within a short-term timeframe (1-5 years). The Northridge Estates Phase II stormwater management wet pond was constructed in 1997 and is located within Turtle Pond Park in the Citys north end. The wet pond services primarily residential land uses and is comprised of a forebay pool and main cell pool. This project will primarily consist of the removal of 3026 cubic metres of sediment (via drain and excavate), but will also include other remedial needs such as signage repair and replacement, repair or replacement of equalization pipe and repair eroded berm between forebay and main bay.  All remedial needs have been identified in the 2015 assessment. The preliminary estimated cost for this project includes estimates for average transportation and tipping fees to dispose the sediment at an approved receiving facility.

Repair includes changing seal and valve. These are defective and are out of service for now and cause problem in the distribution system. To repair them, we will be required to turn off the water to a few street blocks, dig to replace a stuck\/broken valve and repair\/replace valve stems and casings, lift apart the ones that are dripping to investigate and replace defective seat\/seal. A Boil Water Advisory will have to be issued during the course of the work, a series of bacti samples will be required to lift the boil water advisories afterwards.

Please see notes for original project information*** The objective of this project is to prevent the cement walls of the municipal water system's storage standpipe from deterioration and thereby extend the useful life of the standpipe.  The scope of the project includes:  emptying the standpipe of its water (approximately 2,200 cubic meters); sandblasting the interior (approximately 1,025 square meters); removing all the debris and cleaning the interior; recoating the interior with two coats of epoxy coating; and then refilling the standpipe with water.   The desired output is to prevent water seepage though the concrete walls which would cause the walls to crack and deteriorate over time due to the fluctuating temperatures (freezing\/thawing).  This will extend the useful life of the standpipe and eliminate the need for costly repairs or even replacement of the standpipe.  The higher project cost was because we use a different epoxy coating system that could be applied in colder weather (project never started until the end of November 2017 and was completed December 22, 2017). The original epoxy coating recommended by our OCWA engineers was a Carboline Coating system. During tender, contractors were unwilling to quote a fixed price contract since the quality of the interior surface of the tank was unknown. The Carboline System requires a relatively smooth surface. This meant that if the contractor found that surface repair was required, it would cost us more to complete the project. To avoid this, the winning bidder recommended that we use a Gemite Coating System that allow to coat the interior without significant repair and at no additional cost. Our engineers approved this change in scope to the project.  The different epoxy coating system provides a better performance on rougher cement surfaces.

The Cobden Water Plant supplies potable water to roughly 980 users within the Village of Cobden. In 2008 the Water Plant underwent a major upgrade but the project neglected to replace the undersized stationary diesel gen set. The existing undersized diesel emergency generator set at the Cobden Water Plant has resulted in the inability to run the back-wash process while operating high lift and low lift pumps (all new equipment introduced during the 2008 upgrades). In the event of an extended power outage, there is only a short time to supply water to the system until the filter need to initiate a backwash on loss of head, time and turbidity. The inability to backwash the filter will result in no further treated water entering the clearwell as elevated levels of filter turbidity will lock out the system. Both the clearwell and the elevated tower will become depleted in a short time if demand is high. Backwashing of the filter is a requirement of the treatment process and when treating surface water, the elevated level of organics in the source water demands continuous backwashing. The locking out of the system as a result of filter turbidity levels is a requirement of Provincial Legislation (O. Reg. 170 of the Safe Drinking Water Act). Elevated turbidity in source water will harbor unwanted bacteria in populations that the disinfection process may miss or be ineffective. If the Plant cannot backwash as required, the Plant will not produce clean, safe drinking water to replenish the clearwell or elevated tower via the high lift pumps.  <br \/>Construction Start Date:2018-06-01 <br \/>Construction End Date:2018-08-31            " }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -76.877468, 45.628184, 0.0 ] } }

An Environmental Assessment is required by the Ministry of Environment prior to the construction of a third clarifier. The work is considered necessary due to Fisheries Act Regulation. The detailed design of a third Final Clarifier to improve the WWTP's ability to treat existing loadings and increase redundancy for this critical unit process. To construct a 3rd Clarifier, it will be necessary to relocate both the WWTP's access road and the WWTP water supply. Relocation of the access road also causes the need to replace existing WWTP Security Fencing. Because of the nature of this work (i.e. general site works construction), it would be advantageous to have it completed before the Clarifier Construction which is mostly a structural project. The investigations of WWTP capacity has also identified that wastewater currently by-passes the WWTP inlet. The result is that a portion of the WWTP inflow on some days is not measured, recorded and accounted for when assessing and managing the plant loads. Installation of a flow meter on the return line from the Peak Flow Storage Lagoon would allow this wastewater stream to be quantified which will benefit both current assessments and long-term operations. A 3rd Clarifier will require a scum pump similar to those on the existing clarifiers. Although the best approach is still subject to detailed design, there will also be long-term value in increasing the Return Activated Sludge (RAS) pumping capacity.

The project data will capture critical information such as life cycle activities and asset life expectancy which are required for maintenance planning and execution. The project will provide base level (overland infrastructure) information that will form the foundation of an asset based GIS layer. This layer is intended to remain active, allowing for updates on inspections and condition assessments that will in turn guide future maintenance expenditures and provide system performance data.  An updated life cycle investment profile will also be developed for the overland stormwater system based on the capital requirements for the renewal of the City's existing infrastructure. This project will  consist primarily of experienced in-field inspectors identifying and assessing the condition of individual assets of the City's overland stormwater system via an asset record template.  The inspectors will record the location (GPS) of each overland stormwater asset (linear or point feature) to create an updated GIS layer.  Linear features will be divided by a determined length and managed as individual assets for efficient maintenance planning and expenditure.

The purpose of the permanent storage volume in a pond is to allow suspended solids (sediment) from the runoff to settle down in the pond bottom  and release  the treated water to the creek. Over the time, pond will accumulate sediment which will reduce the permanent storage, impacting the sediment removal efficiency of the pond drastically, resulting untreated water released to the Creek. Realising a need for a pond clean out, Town of Whitby conducted a ponds need study in 2011 to evacuate the  pond permanent storage capacity and learned majority of the ponds require cleanout as bathymetric survey revealed fair amount of sediment accumulated in the ponds.

SCOPE: The scope of this project includes the replacement of 352 metres of 300-375mm diameter vitrified clay sanitary sewers from Central Avenue to the Niagara Parkway that were constructed in 1925. The sanitary sewer is in a poor structural state and is beyond the end of its service life, as such, replacement of the sanitary sewer is the recommended rehabilitation alternative along with the replacement of maintenance holes and sanitary laterals. This is a priority project for the Town. Town Council has accelerated this project to design in 2016 and construction in 2017 through administrative report IS-22-2016. This project was originally forecast for design in 2018 with construction forecast for 2019. The design for this project is currently being completed by an engineering design firm with a planned 2017 construction start. OUTPUT: The estimated reduction in stormwater (inflow & infiltration) entering the wastewater distribution system is approximately 2,700 cubic meters per annum as a direct result of the replacement of the sanitary sewer, maintenance holes and service laterals. This project will directly contribute to reduce point source sanitary overflows to meet both regulatory requirements and objectives of the remedial action plan for the Niagara River.  <br \/>Construction Start Date:2017-04-30 <br \/>Construction End Date:2018-11-16            " }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -78.916411, 42.930694, 0.0 ] } }

The initial estimates did not include the open cut works.  The project includes: (1) 2,200 meters of intercept sewer lining (ranges in size from 1050mm to 1200 mm; crosses under 3 roadways). (2) Replacement of 2 failed maintenance holes. (3) Rehabilitation of 26 maintenance holes. The project is incremental: even though a design was near completion, the project had been removed from our 2017 capital budget due to insufficient regional funding. The CWWF funding will allow us to proceed. The Stamford interceptor sewer is in service since 1964 and has extensive corrosion from hydrogen sulphide attack. Rehabilitation of the trunk sewer will provide a reliable and sustainable service to Niagara Falls residents, business and tourists. This project will be done by trenchless construction (insertion of a glass reinforced plastic pipe liner). This is typically cheaper and more resistant to corrosion. It will extend the life by over 50 years. In addition it has a smaller carbon foot print  than traditional open-cut digging methods.   Phase I consists of the rehabilitation of the trunk sewer from Dorchester Rd pump station to Portage Road. Currently the project is in preliminary design, the pipe condition is under review to determine if the pipe should be replaced or is eligible for trenchless technology lining. Construction from Dorchester Rd pump station to Drummond Rd pump station is scheduled to begin Fall 2016. The construction from Drummond Rd pump station to Portage Rd is scheduled to begin in 2017.

Water is brought into the Lester Smith Building, treated and used for kitchen, washrooms and rink flooding, waste is also pumped under ground to the adjacent property to supply the ambulance dispatch and Fire Hall where it is ultra-violet (UV) treated again and used for kitchen, washrooms and washing; the issue associated with this is that the production of the well is low and pumping it to a second facility is difficult, resulting in low availability and pressure in both locations. A third building located at 7 Third Avenue is serviced by a well drilled by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry more than 40 years ago, is more than 200 m from the facility and does not provide adequate supply. The objective of this project is to drill a well, which will be properly sealed, provide adequate safe water at each of the three facilities which will provide; better public service to the Recreation Centre, the firehall to fill trucks onsite for fire protection and adequate water to the Municipal Offices and Seniors Centre and reducing the amount of distribution piping and pumping required (i.e. 32 Hay Creek Road Lester Smith Community Centre, 31 Hay Creek Road Ambulance dispatch centre and Fire Hall and 7 Third Avenue Whitney Senior Centre, fitness centre and Township Municipal Office).  Each of these locations are open public facilities that serve a few thousand people during regular operations, as well as special events held within them each year. Being able to complete these three wells in one contract would be more cost effective. The result would be more economical for the township to operate and would reduce the risk associated with using a shallow unconfined well to provide water to a public facilities. <br \/>Construction Start Date:2017-05-01 <br \/>Construction End Date:2018-09-30            " }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -78.240699, 45.486084, 0.0 ] } }

This includes Marineland which is one of the largest tourist destinations in the City.  In 2011 a condition assessment was completed and identified that major components in the pumping station require replacement and upgrades. This prompted a design assignment to rehabilitate the pumping station.  The design work is nearing completion (90%) and the following upgrades are needed:  Pumps (4)  Mechanical systems (internal piping and 15 valves),  Complete replacement of the Electrical and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems including a new electrical room to meet building code requirements  Roof replacement (new sloped roof to replace existing 1,500 ft² flat roof)  Odor control system  Site works (security fence, laneway paving and landscaping)   Pump station pumping capacity will be improved to meet requirements of the Ministry of Environment & Climate Change Environmental Compliance Approval (MOECC ECA).  Currently this station is pumping at 450 l\/s and the environmental compliance approval (ECA) stipulates 576 l\/s The Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) Tank and Sewage Pumping Station (SPS) were originally tendered in 2013. Due to unforeseen Contractor performance issues, the project was terminated. In 2015 the Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) Tank assignment was awarded to a new Contractor. Upgrades to the Sewage Pumping Station (SPS) were not included as part of the new award. The Sewage Pumping Station (SPS) design is 90% complete. The cost estimate for mechanical and electrical upgrades is based on prorated tendered costs from the original tendering phase, and cost estimates for the roof, odor control system and site works are based on consultant 90% design estimate.

The Fifth St. Sewage Pumping Station is the last pumping station in the Town of Hearst's wastewater collection system. During the spring thaw, the Mattawishkwia River rises to elevations higher than the level of the pumping station's 600mm bypass pipe, thus adding additional volume that is pumped to the sewage lagoons. This added volume from the river increases the volume sent for treatment in the lagoons by at least 15%, increasing energy consumption unnecessarily, causing additional wear and tear on equipment, and most significantly - increasing the potential for sewer backups into houses in the vicinity when the station's pump capacity is exceeded.

Completion of this project is critical to the safe\/ efficient supply of water to the community, thus reducing potential impact on the Province's health system. <br \/>Construction Start Date:2017-04-02 <br \/>Construction End Date:2017-10-30            " }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -80.174706, 44.821364, 0.0 ] } }

Due to a lack of funding at the onset of the project, this is being implemented in 2 phases.  Phase 1 is complete and consists of a treatment system for the residue discharge from the settling tanks. Phase 2 (the proposed project) will include a treatment system for filter backwash wastewater and sedimentation tanks.  Currently, backwash wastewater is discharged directly to the Tay River without any treatment.  This system will provide treatment for approximately 100 m3 of backwash wastewater that is discharged every 2-3 days on average, and wastewater from bi-annual cleaning of the sedimentation tanks. The proposed project includes construction and engineering for an in-ground backwash equalization tank (BET) to provide clarification of the supernatant to meet effluent criteria of 15 mg\/L of total suspended solids (TSS) and dechlorination to meet 0.02 mg\/L of Total Residual Chlorine (TRC).   During filter backwashing, wastewater will be sent by gravity to the BET.  The wastewater will settle in the tank for a period of several hours, after which a floating decanting mechanism will be automatically engaged to skim the supernatant from the surface and direct it to the Tay River.  Settled solids (sludge) in the BET will then be pumped to the onsite Phase 1 treatment system, which uses passive dewatering through geotextiles (Geotubes). The Geotubes produce high quality filtrate that can be discharged directly into the river.  The solids retained in the bags are a source of material for beneficial re-use as landfill cover or other potential construction activities.   <br \/>Construction Start Date:2017-04-01 <br \/>Construction End Date:2017-08-31            " }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -76.262636, 44.903687, 0.0 ] } }

The hydrants repairs are critical for watermain flushing and for ensuring the watermain pressure is maintained in the system.  Once the hydrant works are complete we will be able to flush the system once or twice a year, by letting water flow freely out of hydrants to remove the deposits in the watermains and pipes. Leaving deposits in the pipe will reduce the capacity of the watermains to distribute drinking water in the community. Work will be completed in several locations along Pizhew Road, Mikinaa Road, Madden's Road, Blacky's Bay Road, Roundhouse Road, Killer Hill Road, Aazhawaashiik Road, Indian Road, Onigaming Road, Ketemiikana Drive ,Old Madden Road, Abinoonjii Road, Anishinaabe Road, Achitamoo Road, Mashkiig Road, Powwow Trail Road, and Siibiinsing Road. The project scope will include the following: 1.) We will replace or repair the seal at hydrant #11. This hydrant is near the school rink, and the seal is badly corroded and pitted. Every time it is opened the rubber washer wears away and the metal seat may fail. 2.) We will replace or repair the shaft at Hydrant #14. This hydrant is near Jimmy spruce, and the shaft is bent and is difficult to open and close. 3.) We will replace or repair stripped metal fixtures at hydrant #15. This hydrant is near Fred kelly, and because the metal part is stripped we have to operate it using the shut off valve next to the hydrant creating a serious water pressure issue. 4.) We will purchase and install rubber washer for five hydrants that are chipped or over compressed. To complete the work we will also need to clear the areas around the hydrants, and will install safety markings at each hydrant. The off-reserve benefits of improving the reliability of water services to the community include reducing the risk of system failure and mitigating the potential impact on the health care system of the province.  <br \/>Construction Start Date:2017-01-02 <br \/>Construction End Date:2018-03-01            " }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -93.926339, 49.111112, 0.0 ] } }

Guelph's stormwater infrastructure requires rehabilitation, particularly at two of the City's critical facilities. Repair of the two high priority ponds will reduce potential for flooding of local upstream urban areas and significantly improve quality of water and eco-system health of the Eramosa and Speed Rivers and their tributaries. Critical rehabilitation such as inlet\/outlet repairs will be completed along with sediment removal to restore the full capacity and benefits of the facilities. Guelph's 2012 Sustainable Infrastructure Report and Infrastructure Scorecard showed that stormwater infrastructure is currently funded at less than half of the estimated amount needed to sustain the system with a $4.1 million funding gap. Construction would begin as of July 1, 2017 with completion by September of 2017, broken down by $1,200,000 for the Tovell Drive at Elmira Road Pond,  and $300,000 for the Hilldale Pond. Scope Change Request: The City was able to complete the required repairs to two of its priority ponds (Tovell Drive at Elmira Road Pond and Holldale Pond) through CWWF funding, efficiently and under budget.  In addition to these two facilities, the City has prioritized sediment removal for all the City owned stormwater management ponds based on their available capacity.  As such, the City would like to request a simple expansion to the project to include: 1. Pond ID: 3 - Hanlon Road\/Shadybrook Cresent Pond (Estimated Cost of $650,320) 2. Pond ID: 73 - Hazelwood Drive\/Quail Creek Drive Pond (Estimated Cost of $228,100).

The open water at the lagoon is of great concern for public safety. The lagoon is located a short distance on the outskirts of town and it is not under supervision 24\/7. We propose to install 1600 meters of a 6 feet high chain link fence complete with gates to secure the property. Our Public Works Department prepared the original estimate for the job. Being a small municipality and with no engineer on staff we did not have the expertise to put together an engineered cost projection for the project. The dollar($) amounts for putting the estimate together  were obtained by going to the local supply store and asking prices for the individual items required. The individual prices were then tallied up and we got a total project cost for materials. Then the Public Works department guesstimated on the number of man hours that would be needed to get the job done, multiplied those hours by the average hourly rate and derived the total labour cost which was then added to the estimated material cost and added both costs to arrive at an estimated total cost for the project.  What we did not take into consideration was the discounted contractor when purchasing the material as well as the fact that the contractor had  all necessary equipment to get the job done quicker and more efficiently.

SCOPE: The scope of this project includes the replacement of 220 metres of 450mm diameter vitrified clay sanitary sewers from Bertie Street to Catherine Street that were constructed in 1925.   The sanitary sewer is in a poor structural state and is beyond the end of its service life.  Replacement of the sanitary sewer is the recommended rehabilitation alternative along with the replacement of maintenance holes and sanitary laterals. Additionally, the project includes the replacement of 110 metres of 150mm diameter cast iron watermain constructed in 1920 from Catharine Street to Murray Street. The watermain is beyond the end of its service life and is prone to failure which leads to water quality concerns.  Considering the age of the watermain, replacement of the watermain is the recommended rehabilitation alternative. This is a priority project for the Town. Town Council has accelerated this project to design in 2016 and construction in 2017 through administrative report IS-22-2016. The design for this project is currently being completed by an engineering design firm with a planned 2017 construction start. OUTPUT: The estimated reduction in stormwater (inflow & infiltration) entering the wastewater distribution system is approximately 2,300 cubic meters per annum as a direct result of this project. The replacement of the watermain will improve system reliability; reduce operational issues as well as reducing opportunities for negative impacts to water quality. This project will directly contribute to reduce point source sanitary overflows to meet both regulatory requirements and objectives of the remedial action plan for the Niagara River. <br \/>Construction Start Date:2017-04-30 <br \/>Construction End Date:2018-11-16            " }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -78.912921, 42.915812, 0.0 ] } }

SCOPE: The scope of this project includes the replacement of 220 metres of 450mm diameter vitrified clay sanitary sewers from Bertie Street to Catherine Street that were constructed in 1925.  The sanitary sewer is in a poor structural state and is beyond the end of its service life.  Replacement of the sanitary sewer is the recommended rehabilitation alternative along with the replacement of maintenance holes and sanitary laterals. Additionally, the project includes the replacement of 110 metres of 150mm diameter cast iron watermain constructed in 1920 from Catharine Street to Murray Street. The watermain is beyond the end of its service life and is prone to failure which leads to water quality concerns.  Considering the age of the watermain, replacement of the watermain is the recommended rehabilitation alternative. This is a priority project for the Town. Town Council has accelerated this project to design in 2016 and construction in 2017 through administrative report IS-22-2016. The design for this project is currently being completed by an engineering design firm with a planned 2017 construction start. OUTPUT: The estimated reduction in stormwater (inflow & infiltration) entering the wastewater distribution system is approximately 2,300 cubic meters per annum as a direct result of this project. The replacement of the watermain will improve system reliability; reduce operational issues as well as reducing opportunities for negative impacts to water quality. This project will directly contribute to reduce point source sanitary overflows to meet both regulatory requirements and objectives of the remedial action plan for the Niagara River.  <br \/>Construction Start Date:2017-04-30 <br \/>Construction End Date:2018-11-16            " }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -78.912921, 42.915812, 0.0 ] } }

The project is incremental in nature in that the project had been removed from our 2017 capital budget due to insufficient regional funding required to proceed with the construction phase. The CWWF will allow us to proceed with a key infrastructure project.   The Niagara Falls Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) treats sewage from approximately 127,410 people, and supports the demand of over 30 million tourists. This Class 4 WWTP was built in 1964 and the Flocculation, Grit and Primary Tank system are original to the plant. Niagara Falls WWTP has operational limitations in the secondary treatment process.  The Ministry of Environment and Climate change is aware of this challenge and is strongly encouraging the Region to correct this operational issue.  This is a result of significant sulphide loading from the primary tanks to the rotating biological contactors. High levels of hydrogen sulphide are a result of the inability to adequately control retention times in the grit, flocculation and primary tanks. All existing slide gate valves in these tanks have reached the end of their service life (valves in primary tanks 1, 2 and 3 are original 1964).

The project includes cleaning of outlets and restoration of the disturbed area. Majority of the Towns storm water ponds had been constructed with permanent storage volume (wet ponds). The purpose of the permanent storage volume in a pond is to allow suspended solids (sediment) from the runoff to settle down in the pond bottom  and release  the treated water to the creek. Over the time, pond will accumulate sediment which will reduce the permanent storage, impacting the sediment removal efficiency of the pond drastically, resulting untreated water released to the Creek. Realising a need for a pond clean out, Town of Whitby conducted a ponds need study in 2011 to evacuate the  pond permanent storage capacity and learned majority of the ponds require cleanout as bathymetric survey revealed fair amount of sediment accumulated in the ponds. Under this project accumulated sediment in the pond will be removed allowing required permanent storage in the pond, resulting pond will perform to its design efficiency which will improve the quality of the runoff released to the creeks.

The alternatives will be identified and analysed based on impacts to the environment and public health, as well as social, technical, and economic feasibility. The community is currently serviced by groundwater under the influence of surface water. Surface runoff in the community is prevalent as a result of not having stormwater management in place. Surface runoff affects the quality of groundwater and is therefore a significant threat to the drinking water supply in the community. Surface runoff containing untreated sewage from private residences and cottages combined with agricultural runoff on the Island has also impacted the surrounding Lake Scugog, and the effects are highly visible along the shoreline of the lake.  The creation of an effective stormwater management plan will help the community protect its groundwater resource from contamination and protect the natural ecology of Lake Scugog by minimizing the current rate of degradation. In addition, due to the topography of the community being generally flat and surrounded by wetland features, the community often experiences severe flooding and very wet ground conditions. These conditions pose risks to public health and safety of the residents, in addition to limiting the opportunities for economic development and future growth of the community. A comprehensive stormwater management plan will enable the community to plan, guide, monitor, and implement stormwater management initiatives that provide the best mitigative measures for flood control, protection of groundwater (the only viable source of drinking water on the island), and protection of the surrounding Lake Scugog (off reserve benefit). <br \/>Construction Start Date:2017-12-01 <br \/>Construction End Date:2019-03-31            " }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -78.881213, 44.198608, 0.0 ] } }

Please see notes for original project information*** \"The Robert Adams storm water management Pond was tendered for rehabilitation and sediment cleanout in summer 2016 including removal of 1,200 m3 of sediment. The contract was awarded on the basis of 3 stages to be completed over 3 years. Stage 1 construction was completed in 2016 and funded by the annual budget (approximately $90,000). The remaining Stage 2 and Stage 3 works are scheduled for 2017\/2018 construction with an estimated cost of $180,000 remaining to be split over 2 years. We note that Central Lake Ontario Conservation Authority (CLOCA) has expressed their preference to complete the remaining works in 2017 rather than over 2017\/2018 to minimize the number of disruptions to the local environment. The project was identified in the SWMFMG report as an immediate priority; the estimated year of sediment removal was 2012. As such, cleanout of the Robert Adams Pond is Claringtons top priority, we have nominated this project on the basis that the funding will accelerate the project for completion in 2017. The storm water management (SWM) pond is located in Courtice, Ontario draining to Farewell Creek. The removal works are capitalized as they extend the life of the asset.  The scope was increased to complete cleanout and rehabilitation of the quantity control cell of the Robert Adams Pond because the outlet grate was 90% blocked and required removal of an additional 90m3 of sediment from the pond.  This change in scope resulted in an increase of $90,000. Due to delays in developing the agreement , an extension beyond the March 31, 2018 deadline is required.

SCOPE: The scope of this project includes the replacement of 630 metres of 200-375mm diameter vitrified clay sanitary sewers from Aberdeen Street to Waterloo Street that were constructed in 1925. The sanitary sewer is in a poor structural state and is beyond the end of its service life, as such, replacement of the sanitary sewer is the recommended rehabilitation alternative along with the replacement of maintenance holes and sanitary laterals. Additionally, the project includes the replacement of 240 metres of 150mm diameter cast iron watermain constructed in 1920 from Aberdeen Street to Central Avenue. The watermain is beyond the end of its service life and is prone to failure leading to water quality concerns. Considering the age of the watermain, replacement of the watermain is the recommended rehabilitation alternative. This is a priority project for the Town. Town Council has accelerated this project to design in 2016 and construction in 2017 through administrative report IS-22-2016. This project was originally forecast for design in 2018 with construction forecast for 2019. This project has a planned 2017 construction start. OUTPUT: The estimated reduction in stormwater (inflow & infiltration) entering the wastewater distribution system is approximately 4,000 m3 per annum as a result of replacing the sanitary sewer, maintenance holes and service laterals. The replacement of the watermain will improve system reliability; reduce operational issues as well as reducing opportunities for negative impacts to water quality.

Also, this project will allow the purchase and the installation of a new groundwater pump to replace an existing old pump (Pump #2). Our water plant (WT) pumps water  to the distribution and the reservoir in a fill and drain cycle, allowing the water pumps to rest in between cycles.  While the reservoir is off-line and isolated for repairs the water supply water will come from the WP pumps, running continuously. Should a pump shut down, the plant would switch to the second pump. During this period the Town would be relying on 2 groundwater supply wells at the WTP. Pump #1 is new (2011); Pump #2 was installed in 1949. The most recent inspection said it is beyond repair. A quote to replace Pump #2 and air scour Well #2 has been provided ($48,104.00) by International Well Supply (IWS). IWS was the original well driller\/pump installer when our wells were installed 65 years ago. IWS employs a crew of licenced well drillers and engineers that have the expertise to source replacements and conduct installations. Both our wells are approx. 10-15 feet apart; they are hydraulically connected, and service on one well\/pump affects the other. It iscritical that anyone performing maintenance activities on either well have the knowledge and experience to ensure the continued supply of drinking water throughout the procedure.

The estimates were refined through the preliminary design process identified the opportunity to also undertake the work necessary to reach construction-ready (tender) status.   The Convent Glen Storm Trunk identified for rehabilitation work extends from the north side of RR174 in the Orleans N-W neighborhood discharging into the Ottawa River. The original pipes were 3000 mm - 4500 mm in diameter, made of Structural Plate Corrugated Steel (SPCSP) vertical ellipse shape (VE) and extend for approximately 1.44km Through detailed investigation revealed several locations with severe corrosion as well as associated appurtenances in poor shape unsafe to use (i.e. maintenance holes unsafe for access), thus the sewer is recommended for rehabilitation. The 3000\/4500mm CSP sewer is located west of Jeanne D'Arc Blvd and runs behind homes and under pathways within City owned parcels. This project will provide for the design of the trunk sewer using trenchless methods of rehabilitation. This is recommended for this deep sewer.

The current method of aeration at Cobourg's Normar Road plant is the use of mechanical paddle aerators. This technology relies on the action of surface paddles producing plumes of droplets above the surface of the liquid in the tank. The droplets have a larger surface area for oxygen transfer from the air to the droplets than the liquid surface in the tank alone. Diffused air systems on the other hand involve the installation of piping along the bottom of the tank through which air is pumped, producing bubbles which rise to the surface transferring oxygen to the liquid. This system is superior to the mechanical paddle aerators in several ways; the oxygen transfer is more efficient, mixing is much better, and the electric motors used to power the system consume less energy than the mechanical aerator motors. The increased efficiency of the oxygen transfer process increases the capacity of the plant which postpones the need to expand the plant beyond the current expected time.  Due to delays in tendering, we are requesting an extension beyond the March 31, 2018 deadline to ensure successful completion of the project. More time is required to complete the design and tendering of the project because to tender the project during the summer months when contractors are already busy will increase the cost of the project.

SCOPE: The scope of this project includes the replacement of 630 metres of 200-375mm diameter vitrified clay sanitary sewers from Aberdeen Street to Waterloo Street that were constructed in 1925. The sanitary sewer is in a poor structural state and is beyond the end of its service life, as such, replacement of the sanitary sewer is the recommended rehabilitation alternative along with the replacement of maintenance holes and sanitary laterals. Additionally, the project includes the replacement of 240 metres of 150mm diameter cast iron watermain constructed in 1920 from Aberdeen Street to Central Avenue. The watermain is beyond the end of its service life and is prone to failure leading to water quality concerns. Considering the age of the watermain, replacement of the watermain is the recommended rehabilitation alternative. This is a priority project for the Town. Town Council has accelerated this project to design in 2016 and construction in 2017 through administrative report IS-22-2016. This project was originally forecast for design in 2018 with construction forecast for 2019. This project has a planned 2017 construction start. OUTPUT: The estimated reduction in stormwater (inflow & infiltration) entering the wastewater distribution system is approximately 4,000 m3 per annum as a result of replacing the sanitary sewer, maintenance holes and service laterals. The replacement of the watermain will improve system reliability; reduce operational issues as well as reducing opportunities for negative impacts to water quality.

To repair all of them, we will turn off the water to a few street blocks, dig to replace valves and repair and replace valve stems and casings, lift apart the ones that are dripping to investigate and replace defective seat\/seal.   After completion of the work the operating authority (OCWA) will be able to conduct a thorough distribution system flush to help distributing a good water quality to all residence. The fire hydrants serve many purposes in the distribution system other than firefighting. They allow to do maintenance work such as conducting high flow flushing to help keep the distribution pipes clean, they are needed to flush out stagnant water at the dead ends in the distribution system. We need to have all fire hydrants and distribution valves working to conduct a swabbing program, swabs are inserted into the distribution system through hydrants and directed to a another hydrant by valving. This is why hydrants and valves are a very important and integral part of the distribution system. After digging, an inspection revealed that repairs to some of the hydrants were less than anticipated therefore reducing the cost of the project.

The system currently services 162 residential units, 16 commercial establishments and 12 institutional properties, for a total of 282 user units (flat billing) in 2016. Currently servicing approximately 350 residents and businesses. With such a small limited number of users on the wastewater system, it is difficult to keep annual maintenance costs from increasing when faced with huge capital expenditures that the users are also responsible for. The current impact is intrusion of stormwater and snowmelt into compromised manholes and sewer mains.  As a direct result, the municipal lagoons have experienced overflow events resulting in premature releases of untreated or partially treated effluents. This has also resulted in increased pump hours occurring at the sewer lift station also as a result of this intrusion.
